    <h1 class="hero-title mb-4">About Us</h1>

    <p class="hero-subtitle mb-5">
        TQtadka is not just another content website. It is a platform built with one simple goal —
        to make useful information easy, fast, and enjoyable to read.
    </p>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <p>
            In a world full of long, complicated articles and confusing jargon, we wanted to create something different.
            Something clean. Something practical. Something that respects your time.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s how TQtadka was born.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">What We Do</h4>
        <p>
            At TQtadka, we publish content across a wide range of topics, including:
        </p>
        <ul class="ps-3">
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Technology</li>
            <li>Finance & Business</li>
            <li>Health & Fitness</li>
            <li>Beauty & Lifestyle</li>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>And more</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
            But our focus is not just on covering topics — it’s on how we present them.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe information should be:
        </p>
        <ul class="ps-3">
            <li>Easy to understand</li>
            <li>Well-structured</li>
            <li>Free from unnecessary fluff</li>
            <li>And genuinely useful</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
            That’s why most of our content is written in a fast, bullet-based, and reader-friendly format.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
        <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why TQtadka is Different</h4>
        <p>
            There are thousands of blogs on the internet. So why another one?
        </p>
        <p>
            Because most of them:
        </p>
        <ul class="ps-3">
            <li>Either overcomplicate simple things</li>
            <li>Or rush content just for traffic</li>
            <li>Or sound robotic and repetitive</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
            We wanted to build a platform that:
        </p>
        <ul class="ps-3">
            <li>Respects readers’ intelligence</li>
            <li>Delivers clarity, not confusion</li>
            <li>Focuses on quality over quantity</li>
            <li>And grows organically, not artificially</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
            TQtadka is built slowly, carefully, and with long-term vision.
        </p>
